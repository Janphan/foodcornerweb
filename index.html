			<h2 id="title">A place for people who love food and discover</h2>
			<p class="content">Moving to Helsinki, the capital of Finland, with a lot of interesting different cuisines,
				I believe in the future years, I will have chances to discover the city and Finland. </p>
			<p class="content">So one of the reason for the website is that this website will be not only for memorizing
				but also as a guideline for people who are new here.</p>
			<p><video controls>  <source src="foodcorner_intro.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

			<p class="content">Another reason would be because when I first came to Helsinki, I did not know much places
				to eat out, especially when I was craving for some Vietnamese food or some street food.</p>
			<p class="content">Therefore, I have googled and seen some websites, with reviews and photos, which looked
				interesting to me.</p>
			<p class="content">Luckily enough that I have chances to try new restaurants and discover some very
				interesting sites. However, not every places that I have visited are suitable for my taste as well as
				meet my expectation.</p>
			<img src="images/layout.jpeg" alt="Some examples of dishes in restaurants Helsinki" class="vertical-img">
			<p class="content">Moreover, I have a tendency to take a lot of food and places photos fullfiled with
				memories and emotions that I would like to share.</p>
			<p class="content">To be honest, the first idea for the website is like a check-in lists, so that I would
				have an "official" site to recommend to my friends, or to look back when I want to eat out.</p>
			<p class="content">And finally, I am not a big fan of other social media like Instagram and Facebook, so I
				find this website is a hidden corner, which is still private but somehow public.</p>
			<p class="content">Therefore, here it is - welcome to Food Corner!</p>
