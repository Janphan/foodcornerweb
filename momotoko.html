		<p class="content">You can find more information about the restaurant and menu from <a href="https://momotoko.com/">Momotoko's Website</a></p>
		<p class="content">There are some of my favourite dishes that I can recommend:</p>
		<img src="images/momotoko.jpeg" alt = "Dish name 1 in City Center Helsinki Finland">
		<p class="content">Above picture was my second time visiting Momotoko for lunch. One reason I chose the restaurant from this time was that it was not crouded even in peak time for officers' lunch. I was again satisfied with its service as well as the delicious dish.</p>
		<img src="images/momotoko curry shrimp ramen.jpeg" alt = "Curry Tempura shrimp ramen in City Center Helsinki Finland">
		<p class="content">The first ramen I tried in Helsinki was not from Momotoko, and that bowl of ramen was quite salty. I was afraid that Momotoko ramen would be the same.</p>
		<p class="content">However, when my friend recommended this for me, I was not disappointed but super happy with this time. This is called "LAKSA EBI TEMPURA CURRY", no.6 that you can find from the menu.</p>

		<p class="content">The soup favour is sweet from the pork broth I think. It has the unami taste, the fifth taste besides sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness. The ramen is soft and cooked in the right amount of time.</p>	
		<p class="content">As other recipe, there is always half-boil juicy eggs in that bowl of ramen. This one also has the lotus roots, corns and some dry fungus.</p>
